# Personal Budget Tracker

## Overview

The Personal Budget Tracker is an Excel-based tool designed to help individuals track their income and expenses on a monthly basis. It offers a clear, organized way to manage finances by categorizing income sources and expenses, tracking balances, and providing an overview of personal cash flow. The tracker enables users to analyze spending habits, plan budgets, and make informed financial decisions. This tool can be used for both personal financial tracking or as a template for small-scale financial planning.

## Features

1. **Income and Expense Tracking**: Allows users to categorize income and expenses (e.g., salary, rent, groceries, entertainment) for each month of the year.
2. **Monthly Breakdown**: Detailed month-by-month data of income, expenses, and balance.
3. **Cash Flow Analysis**: Tracks the balance after each income or expense transaction, offering a real-time view of financial health.
4. **Data Organization**: All financial information is organized by categories, helping users quickly access and review specific areas of spending or income.
5. **Planned Future Enhancements**: The tracker can be enhanced further with charts and graphs (intended to be added) to visualize spending trends.
